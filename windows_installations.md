## Python
Python is not included with Windows. You must go to the [Python downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) page, download version 3.9, and install it. It will be installed in the `C:\Python39` directory.

After installing it, you must add `C:\Python39` to your system path. Here's how:

1. Press your Windows key.
2. Begin by typing **Control**.
3. The Windows Control Panel should be the first result in the search results. Click on it.
4. When the control panel screen appears, begin typing `environment` in the upper right corner search bar.
5. Choose the option to modify environmental variables. If you are given two options, you may select either one.
6. When the screen appears, click the Environment Variables button at the bottom.
7. Next, select on the `PATH` variable and click the Edit button.
8. Enter a semicolon and the new path entry at the end of the string. `;C:\Python39`
